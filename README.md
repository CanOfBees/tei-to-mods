# tei-to-mods
-----

This repository aims to act as a simple, approximately correct, mostly  
off-the-cuff transform for the TEI header (teiHeader) to MODS.

## Blast From The Past ##

Way back in 2015, I thought this would be a good idea but never went
anywhere with it.

```shell
bridger@spanner|~/Documents/tei/tei-to-mods on default
Â± ls -l
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 3 bridger bridger 4096 May 22  2015 samples
-rw-r--r-- 1 bridger bridger  274 Apr  8 16:50 README.md
-rw-r--r-- 1 bridger bridger 2528 May 22  2015 teiHeader-to-mods.xsl

```

_failure_

So here we are, almost 5 years later, and now:

## What's The Point ##
We need to extract MODS from a mess of TEI.

## How To Use This ##
Stand by for additional details.
